# SHAPEAI 7 Days Free Bootcamp Project

This project was created as part of the **7 Days Free Bootcamp** conducted by [SHAPEAI](http://www.shapeai.tech/).  
The bootcamp was instructed by **Mr. Shaurya Sinha** (Data Analyst Intern at *Jio*), who provided excellent, beginner-friendly guidance throughout the sessions.

## 🧠 Learning Experience

During these 7 days, I gained hands-on experience with:

- **HTML**
- **CSS**

Everything was explained from the very basics, making it easy for anyone—even those with zero programming background—to follow along and build projects confidently.  
This experience was both **educational** and **enjoyable**, and I’m grateful for the opportunity to learn with SHAPEAI.
